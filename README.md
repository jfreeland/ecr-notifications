# ecr-notifications

This was a silly project to play a bit more hands on with AWS CDK and C#.
Inspiration was drawn primarily from
https://github.com/philips-labs/aws-ecr-scanning-slack-notifications and
https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cdk-build-package-publish-dotnet-lambda-function.

It's 'basically' functional for my silly needs.  There's a lot of clean up to
be done.
